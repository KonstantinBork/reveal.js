# Finding Joy in Reviewing Code Notes

## Why Should You Care About Code Reviews?
* Find mistakes before any stage tests
* Learn from more experienced developers
* Share knowledge and keep others in the loop
* Code reviews are a major bottleneck during the development process

## What Makes Code Reviews Difficult?

## How to improve
### General
* Automate code style checks e.g. using linters

### Submitter
* Review your changes yourself before submitting it
* Limit your changes
* Provide as much information as possible
* Add an estimation time needed for the review
* Write a description of your implementation
* Use atomic commits
* Change log, e.g. informative commit messages
* Defend your code but be open to change

### Reviewer
* Do not be a dick! Use non-offensive, suggestive language
* Do not play compiler
* Check the logic
* Ask questions
* When giving suggestions, try giving sources, argue with facts
* Give kudos, use GIFs, use emojis
* Make code reviews your priority, i.e. review within 24h
